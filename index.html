    <p class="subtitle">What is "solarpunk"?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Solarpunk is an optimistic sci-fi art, literary, and social movement imagining sustainable, eco-friendly futures where humanity thrives in harmony with nature, powered by renewable energy and community-focused, post-capitalist values, contrasting dystopian cyberpunk with lush green cities, DIY ethics, and hopeful, nature-tech integration. It's about more than just aesthetics; it's a vision for real-world action, featuring rooftop gardens, local food, clean transport, and technologies seamlessly blending into nature, embodying hope and practical solutions over despair.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hectar Solar was born out of a revolt against the current oppressive system of exploitation both of people and resources.
        We aim for a more sustainable and connected PRESENT and FUTURE. For this, Hectar Solar represents a safe haven for people to become HUMAN again.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul class="project-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Co-Living</strong><br />
          One of the sources of income for the project will be the co-living, where people of all ages can stay with us and become part of the community.
          The co-livers will contribute with a small rent and also with their involvement in the activities held in the space.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustainable Food Systems</strong><br />
          Food is one of the most important elements in life. One of our strategic goals is to create a sustainable source of food, with permaculture techniques and by establishing a healthy food forest.
          The food produced in Hectar Solar will also be distributed in the area, with one of our goals being to establish a travelling grocery shop.
          At the same time, all activities held in Hectar Solar will source food from the region, giving priority to locally grown food.
          <li>
          <strong>Handicrafts Knowledge Transfer</strong><br />
          Traditions are an important part of the cultural heritage of the region. To honor and promote these traditions, we will host workshops held by the local artisans, so that they can share their skills and knowledge to younger generations, preserving the cultural identity and encouraging their sense of purpose and belonging to our project.
        </li>
         <li>
          <strong>European and Regional Trainings</strong><br />
          We believe both in a strong regional identity and also an unshakeable European belonging.
          To further the strategic goals of the European Union, and to bring new dynamics and energy to the local reality, we will host Erasmus+ trainings and local workshops, shaping the community around Hectar Solar.
