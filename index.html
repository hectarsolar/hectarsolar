    <p class="subtitle">What is "Hectar Solar"?</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Hectar Solar is a space of regeneration and reconnection for people who want to go back to a more rural lifestyle. Our mission is to establish a more sustainable and connected PRESENT and FUTURE.
    For this, Hectar Solar represents a safe haven for people to become HUMAN again. It was born as an alternative to the current system of exploitation of both people and resources.
    Our mission revolves around nurturing spaces of community and integration, where nature becomes part of the processes and people are allowed to be authentic and vulnerable.
    We base ourselves on the concept of "solarpunk".

      <h2>Why solarpunk?</h2>
      <p>
         Solarpunk is an optimistic sci-fi art, literary, and social movement imagining sustainable, eco-friendly futures where humanity thrives in harmony with nature, powered by renewable energy and community-focused, post-capitalist values, contrasting dystopian cyberpunk with lush green cities, DIY ethics, and hopeful, nature-tech integration. It's about more than just aesthetics; it's a vision for real-world action, featuring rooftop gardens, local food, clean transport, and technologies seamlessly blending into nature, embodying hope and practical solutions over despair.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul class="project-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Rural Co-Living</strong><br />
          One of the main goals of the project will be to create the conditions for co-living, where people of all ages can stay and become part of the community.
          The co-livers will contribute either financially or with their time, and will be involved in the activities held in the space.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sustainable Food Systems</strong><br />
          Food is one of the most important elements in life. One of our strategic goals is to create a sustainable source of food, with permaculture techniques and by establishing a healthy food forest.
          The food produced in Hectar Solar will also be distributed in the area, with one of our goals being to establish a travelling grocery shop.
          At the same time, all activities held in Hectar Solar will source food from the region, giving priority to locally grown food.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Handicrafts Knowledge Transfer</strong><br />
          Traditions are an important part of the cultural heritage of the region. To honor and promote these traditions, we will host workshops held by the local artisans, so that they can share their skills and knowledge to younger generations, preserving the cultural identity and encouraging their sense of purpose and belonging to our project.
        </li>
         <li>
          <strong>European and Regional Trainings</strong><br />
          We believe both in a strong regional identity and also an unshakeable European belonging.
          To further the strategic goals of the European Union, and to bring new dynamics and energy to the local reality, we will host Erasmus+ trainings and local workshops, shaping the community around Hectar Solar.
